"Selected rubric"  
Solution 5: Linear Search Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a boolean array or hash set to mark present elements [1 mark]  
   - The student has correctly used a `HashSet` to mark present elements. [1 mark]

2. Iterate through the input array and mark each element as present [1 mark]  
   - The student iterates through the array and adds each element to the `HashSet`, marking them as present. [1 mark]

3. Scan through the boolean array or hash set to find the first unmarked element [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly scans through the range from 1 to `arr.length + 1` to find the first missing element. [1 mark]

4. Return the missing number correctly [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly returns the missing number when it is not found in the `HashSet`. [1 mark]
